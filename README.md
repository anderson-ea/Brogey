# Brogey
Sick of playing golf solo or getting paired with randoms? Then try Brogey today! Brogey is a social media web application created to help users find golf partners near their location. [Click here to join](https://brogey-7fb3a.web.app/).

## Description
Brogey was created using React for the frontend, and Firebase BaaS for the backend. After reading [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/qnrq4q/tinder_but_like_for_golfing/) post on Reddit's r/golf, I decided I would give the project a shot. After some research, I thought using React Native would be the perfect fit for such a project. Not wanting to get too far ahead of myself, and making sure I really grasped the concepts of a new language and library, I created Brogey as a web application first. Brogey Mobile coming soon.

## Instructions
Brogey uses Google as the sole sign in method. This is to help ensure less issues come up such as verifying identity, resetting passwords, detecting robot-login storms, etc.

Users must create a profile before viewing other profiles. Rather than uploading a profile picture directly, users must provide a URL address. This is to save storage space.

Brogey uses a sliding feature to look through other golfers. If you'd like to sort just golfers near you, you can type in which city you are interested in.
