# Brogey
Sick of playing golf solo or getting paired with randoms? Then try Brogey today! Brogey is a social media web application created to help users find golf partners near their location. [Click here to join](https://brogey-7fb3a.web.app/)

## Description
Brogey was created using React for the frontend, and Firebase BaaS for the backend. After reading [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/qnrq4q/tinder_but_like_for_golfing/) post on Reddit's r/golf, I decided I would give the project a shot. After some research, I thought using React Native would be the perfect fit for such a project. Not wanting to get too far ahead of myself, I created Brogey as a web application first just using React. Brogey Mobile coming soon.

## Instructions
Brogey uses Google as the sole sign in method. This is to help ensure less issues come up such as verifying identity, resetting passwords, detecting robot-login storms, etc.

Users must create a profile before viewing other profiles. Rather than uploading a profile picture directly, users must provide a URL address. This is to save storage space.

Brogey uses a sliding feature to look through other golfers. If you'd like to sort just golfers near you, you can type in which city you are interested in.

Chat with other golfers and set up tee times! Chat is only available with other users once both of you have matched with each other.
